# TacoAPI
This is the Doxygen documentation for TacoAPI. Doxygen is a more visually pleasing documentation tool, 
but does not comply with the Eclipse standard for adding Javadocs to your project. Note that some 
documentation may not render correctly due this difference in syntax of Doxygen and the `javadoc` tool

in your Eclipse workspace

via Doxygen
